## How to use

### Generating window shape labels

1. RECOMMENDED: initialize and activate a python virtual environment (venv) in the root project folder.

2. Install the required python libraries (pip install -r WindowShapes/requirements.txt).

3. Add the masks into the folders WindowShapes/Masks/SideMirrorMasks WindowShapes/Masks/WindowMasks. Masks can be generated by cloning the sam3-github repo into WindowShapes/sam3 and then running WindowShapes/create_masks.py.

4. Run WindowShapes/main.py to generate the following:

- A HorizontalAlign-folder containing all images rotated so that the car is horizontal, along with rotated original labels for the images.
- A Polygons-folder containing polygons describing the outline of each window section in the processed masks.
- A folder Masks/ProcessedMasks containing masks describing the window shapes.

4. View the resulting masks by running WindowShapes/display_masks.py and the polygons by running WindowShapes/display_polygons.py.
